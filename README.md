# Master List from Google Sheets
 Create an autoupdating master list by pulling data from multiple tabs on a Google sheets workbook. 

 The variable sheetNamesToImport represents the names of the tabs for the source data. 

 The code will create a new tab for the master list if it doesn't already exist. 

 This is not meant to overwrite data that is already in the destination sheet, so it should be empty if you want to populate a new list. Otherwise, it will start at the next available cell.
